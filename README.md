# Inky Display Stuff

Project for using the Pimoroni 3 color display on a Raspberry Pi

Current deployment idea is a mini-display outside my office with various messages or graphics

Ideas currently include:
- Welcome to the site
- Stock of interest
- Logo or other graphic
- Out of office / work from home notification
- Weather / forecast

## Install Directions

Clone to the same directory as an inky repository clone such that the file structure looks like follows:

    Parent Directory
    ├── inky
    │   └── <inky repository files>
    ├── InkyDisplay
    │   └── <this repository files>
    └── <Directory continues>
